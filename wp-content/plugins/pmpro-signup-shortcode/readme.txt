Add a shortcode [pmpro_signup] that can be used to embed a sign up form for Paid Memberships Pro levels.

== Description ==

Use the [pmpro_signup] shortcode to embed a sign up form anywhere on your site. You can place it into sidebar widgets or use popover plugins like Optin Monster and Popup Maker to embed the form into a popover.

If the level is free, the account will be created and the member will be automatically redirected to the specified redirect page. If the level is not free, the user will be taken to the membership checkout page to enter billing information.

Note: This replaces similar functionality that used to be included in the Register Helper Add On for Paid Memberships Pro.

Shortcode attributes for `[pmpro_signup]` include:

1. intro – (optional) Override the default 'Register for LEVEL NAME' text above the checkout form or hide the text completely. (default: true; accepts: true, false, or your custom text)
1. hidelabels - (optional) Hide the form input field labels and use the input field placeholder attribute instead. (default: false; accepts: true, 1, or yes).
1. level – (required) determines which level to use for the checkout form
1. login – (optional) Set this attribute to show a 'Log In' link below the submit button. (i.e. login='1')
1. redirect – (optional) Set the page to redirect to after form submission. (default: Membership Confirmation page. accepts: referrer, account, or your custom URL)
1. short – (optional) determines whether to show the Confirm E-mail and Confirm Password fields OR show E-mail Address field only. (default: false; accepts: true, false, or emailonly)
1. submit_button – (optional) Change the 'Submit' button text on the checkout form. (default: 'Sign Up Now'; accepts: your custom text)
1. title – (optional) Show a heading (h2) with a default 'Level Name' above the checkout form or your custom text. (default: false; accepts: true or your custom text)
1. custom_fields - (optional) If set to false or 0, the pmpro_checkout_after_username, pmpro_checkout_after_email, and pmpro_checkout_before_submit action hooks will not fire. This will stop Register Helper from adding fields to the checkout form. Note that required fields will still be required. If set to true or 1 specifically and Register Helper is loaded, then the pmprorh_pmpro_checkout_boxes() function will fire to include fields from the checkout_boxes area at the bottom of the form.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `pmpro-signup-shortcode` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Add a sign up form to a post/widget/page using a shortcode:
